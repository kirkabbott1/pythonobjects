Objects and Classes

Basics

Given the following Person class:

class Person(object):
    def __init__(self, name, email, phone):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.phone = phone

    def greet(self, other_person):
        print 'Hello %s, I am %s!' % (other_person.name, self.name)
Write code to

Instantiate an instance object of Person with name of 'Sonny', email of 'sonny@hotmail.com', and phone of '483-485-4948', store it in the variable sonny.
Instantiate another person with the name of 'Jordan', email of 'jordan@aol.com', and phone of '495-586-3456', store it in the variable 'jordan'.
Have sonny greet jordan using the greet method.
Have jordan greet sonny using the greet method.
Write a print statement to print the contact info (email and phone) of Sonny.
Write another print statement to print the contact info of Jordan.
Make your own class

Create a class Vehicle. A Vehicle object will have 3 attributes:

make
model
year
A vehicle is created thus:

car = Vehicle('Nissan', 'Leaf', 2015)
And you can access it's attributes individually like so:

print car.make, car.model, car.year
Add a method

Add a print_info method to the Vehicle class. It will print out the vehicle's information like so:

>>> car.print_info()
2015 Nissan Leaf
Add a method 2

Go back to the Person class. Add a print_contact_info method to the Person class that will print out the contact info for a object instance of Person. You will use it thus:

>>> sonny.print_contact_info()
Sonny's email: sonny@hotmail.com, Sonny's phone number: 483-485-4948
Add an instance variable (attribute)

Add a friends instance variable (attribute) to the Person class. You will initialize it to an empty list within the constructor (__init__). Once you've done this you should be able to add a friend to a person using list's append method:

jordan.friends.append(sonny)
sonny.friends.append(jordan)
You should also be able to get the number of friends a person has by using the len function on his friends:

>>> len(jordan.friends)
1
Add a add_friend method

The fact that a person's friends attribute is a list is an implementation detail of the Person class. It is often desired to hide implementation details from the users of your object/class. Implement an add_friend method to Person, so that in order to add a friend, you'd only have to do:

jordan.add_friend(sonny)
Instead of

jordan.friends.append(sonny)
Add a num_friends method

Similarly, to get the number of friends a person has, we'd like to hide the implementation detail that there is a friends attribute which is a list. Implement a num_friends method which returns the number of friends the person currently has:

>>> jordan.num_friends()
1
Count number of greetings

We want to count the number of times a person has greeted someone. To do this, we'll add another attribute, call it say greeting_count, and initialize it to 0. Then each time the greet method is called, we'll increment greeting_count by 1.

>>> sonny.greeting_count
0
>>> sonny.greet(jordan)
>>> sonny.greeting_count
1
>>> sonny.greet(jordan)
>>> sonny.greeting_count
2
__repr__

You may notice that when you are working with a person object, it's representation in the Python shell is pretty cryptic and unhelpful:

>>> jordan
<__main__.Person object at 0x106976410>
You can change that! Just add a __repr__ (dunder rep-er) method to the Person class and have it return a string. Whatever you return there will be used to "represent" your person object. For example, say I want a Person to be represented like <Person Jordan jordan@aol.com 495-586-3456>, I could implement __repr__ thus:

    def __repr__(self):
        return '' % (self.name, self.email, self.phone)
Implement your own __repr__ method, and you can represent your person objects however you want. Incidentally, __repr__ is also used when you use %r to render a value with a format string.
